# Lesson 1: Introduction to Logic

## Overview of Logic

Logic is a systematic method of reasoning that allows us to analyze arguments, draw conclusions, and make decisions based on given information. It is foundational to various fields, including computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. By understanding logic, we can improve our critical thinking skills, enhance our problem-solving abilities, and develop a clearer understanding of how to construct valid arguments.

In computer science, logic is essential for designing algorithms, programming languages, and systems that require precise reasoning. It helps in verifying the correctness of programs and ensuring that they behave as intended. In mathematics, logic underpins the structure of mathematical proofs and theorems, allowing mathematicians to establish truths based on axioms and previously proven statements. In philosophy, logic is used to evaluate arguments, identify fallacies, and explore the nature of truth and knowledge.

## Key Concepts

### Propositions

A proposition is a declarative statement that can be either true or false, but not both. Propositions are the building blocks of logical reasoning. Examples of propositions include:
- "The sky is blue." (This can be true or false depending on the time and conditions.)
- "2 + 2 = 4." (This is always true.)

### Predicates

A predicate is a statement that contains a variable and becomes a proposition when the variable is replaced with a specific value. Predicates allow us to express more complex statements. For example, the predicate "P(x): x is an even number" becomes a proposition when we substitute a specific value for x:
- P(2): "2 is an even number." (True)
- P(3): "3 is an even number." (False)

### Logical Connectives

Logical connectives are symbols used to connect propositions to form more complex statements. The most common logical connectives include:

1. **Conjunction (AND)**: Denoted by ∧, the conjunction of two propositions is true only if both propositions are true.
   - Example: "It is raining AND it is cold."
   
2. **Disjunction (OR)**: Denoted by ∨, the disjunction of two propositions is true if at least one of the propositions is true.
   - Example: "It is raining OR it is sunny."

3. **Negation (NOT)**: Denoted by ¬, the negation of a proposition is true if the proposition is false.
   - Example: "It is NOT raining."

4. **Implication (IF...THEN)**: Denoted by →, an implication states that if the first proposition (antecedent) is true, then the second proposition (consequent) is also true.
   - Example: "If it is raining, THEN the ground is wet."

5. **Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF)**: Denoted by ↔, a biconditional states that both propositions are true or both are false.
   - Example: "It is raining IF AND ONLY IF the ground is wet."

### Truth Tables

Truth tables are a systematic way of representing the truth values of propositions and their combinations. They help us determine the validity of logical expressions. For example, the truth table for the conjunction (AND) connective is as follows:

| P     | Q     | P ∧ Q |
|-------|-------|-------|
| True  | True  | True  |
| True  | False | False |
| False | True  | False |
| False | False | False |

### Logical Equivalence

Two propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in every possible scenario. Logical equivalence is denoted by the symbol ≡. For example, the propositions "P → Q" and "¬P ∨ Q" are logically equivalent. Understanding logical equivalence is crucial for simplifying logical expressions and proving the validity of arguments.

In summary, logic provides the tools necessary for structured reasoning and critical thinking. By mastering the key concepts of propositions, predicates, logical connectives, truth tables, and logical equivalence, you will be well-equipped to tackle more complex logical problems and applications in computer science, mathematics, and philosophy.
