# Lesson 22: Hands-On Workshops and Practical Sessions

## Interactive Workshops Focusing on Implementing Logic and Formal Methods in Real-World Scenarios

This lesson will guide you through hands-on workshops that focus on applying logic and formal methods to real-world scenarios. These workshops will provide practical experience in implementing concepts learned throughout the course, encouraging collaboration and peer feedback.

### Workshop Structure

Each workshop will consist of the following components:

1. **Introduction to the Topic:** A brief overview of the specific logic or formal method being applied.
2. **Hands-On Implementation:** Participants will work on coding exercises or projects that utilize logic and formal methods.
3. **Group Collaboration:** Opportunities for participants to collaborate on projects, share ideas, and provide feedback to one another.
4. **Presentation and Discussion:** Participants will present their work and discuss challenges faced, solutions implemented, and lessons learned.

## Workshop Topics

### Workshop 1: Building a Logic-Based Application

**Objective:** Design and implement a simple logic-based application using Haskell.

**Activities:**
- **Introduction:** Overview of logic programming concepts and Haskell’s features.
- **Implementation:** Participants will create a rule-based expert system, similar to the project from Lesson 18. They will define rules and implement logic to infer conclusions based on user input.
- **Collaboration:** Participants will pair up to discuss their implementations and share insights on rule design and user interaction.
- **Presentation:** Each group will present their expert system, highlighting unique features and challenges encountered.

### Workshop 2: Formal Verification with Haskell

**Objective:** Explore formal verification techniques using Haskell and Liquid Haskell.

**Activities:**
- **Introduction:** Discuss the importance of formal verification and how Liquid Haskell can be used to verify properties of Haskell programs.
- **Implementation:** Participants will write Haskell functions and annotate them with refinement types to ensure correctness. They will verify that their functions adhere to specified properties.
- **Collaboration:** Groups will review each other’s code and annotations, providing feedback on how to improve type specifications and correctness.
- **Presentation:** Groups will present their verified functions, explaining the properties they checked and any challenges faced during verification.

### Workshop 3: Model Checking and Logic Programming

**Objective:** Apply model checking techniques to verify the properties of a simple system.

**Activities:**
- **Introduction:** Overview of model checking concepts and tools (e.g., SPIN, NuSMV).
- **Implementation:** Participants will model a simple system (e.g., a traffic light controller) using a formal specification language and verify its properties using a model checker.
- **Collaboration:** Participants will work in teams to brainstorm potential properties to verify and discuss the results of their model checking.
- **Presentation:** Each team will present their model, the properties they verified, and any insights gained from the model checking process.

### Workshop 4: Addressing Biases in Algorithms

**Objective:** Explore the ethical implications of biases in algorithms and develop strategies to mitigate them.

**Activities:**
- **Introduction:** Discuss the sources of bias in algorithms and their societal impact.
- **Implementation:** Participants will analyze a dataset and identify potential biases. They will develop strategies for mitigating these biases in algorithmic decision-making.
- **Collaboration:** Groups will share their findings and proposed strategies, providing feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- **Presentation:** Each group will present their analysis, strategies for bias mitigation, and reflections on the ethical considerations involved.

## Opportunities for Collaborative Projects and Peer Feedback

Throughout these workshops, participants will have ample opportunities for collaboration and peer feedback:

1. **Group Work:** Participants will work in small groups to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing. This will encourage diverse perspectives and enhance problem-solving capabilities.
  
2. **Peer Review:** After each implementation, groups will engage in peer review sessions where they provide constructive feedback on each other's work. This process will help participants refine their implementations and learn from one another.

3. **Discussion Forums:** Create a space for ongoing discussions about the challenges faced during the workshops and potential solutions. This can be facilitated through online forums or in-person discussions.

4. **Final Presentations:** At the end of the workshop series, participants will present their final projects to the class, showcasing their work and reflecting on their learning experiences. This will provide an opportunity for recognition and further feedback from peers and instructors.

## Conclusion

The hands-on workshops and practical sessions in this lesson provide a valuable opportunity to apply the concepts of logic and formal methods in real-world scenarios. By engaging in collaborative projects and peer feedback, participants will enhance their understanding of these topics and develop practical skills that are essential for success in the field of programming and software development. Through these interactive experiences, participants will be better equipped to tackle complex problems and contribute to the responsible use of technology.
