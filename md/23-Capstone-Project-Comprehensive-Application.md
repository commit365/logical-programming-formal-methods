# Lesson 23: Capstone Project: Comprehensive Application

## Overview of the Capstone Project

The capstone project is a comprehensive application that allows you to integrate and apply all the concepts learned throughout the course. This project will challenge you to utilize logical programming, formal methods, and the skills acquired in previous lessons to create a functional and meaningful application. The capstone project serves as a culmination of your learning experience, showcasing your ability to implement logical reasoning and formal verification in a real-world context.

### Project Objectives

1. **Integration of Concepts:** Demonstrate your understanding of logical programming, formal methods, and their applications in software development.
2. **Practical Implementation:** Develop a functional application that addresses a specific problem or use case.
3. **Collaboration and Feedback:** Work collaboratively with peers to enhance your project and receive constructive feedback.
4. **Presentation Skills:** Present your project effectively, highlighting key features, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Choose a Project Topic

Select a topic for your capstone project that interests you and allows you to apply the concepts learned in the course. Possible project ideas include:

- **Expert System:** Develop an expert system for diagnosing medical conditions based on symptoms.
- **Automated Theorem Prover:** Create a simple theorem prover that can verify mathematical statements or logical formulas.
- **Model Checking Tool:** Implement a model checker for a specific system, such as a traffic control system or a simple protocol.
- **Fuzzy Logic Controller:** Design a fuzzy logic controller for a real-world application, such as temperature regulation or traffic management.

### 2. Define Project Scope

Clearly define the scope of your project, including:

- **Functional Requirements:** Outline the features your application will provide. For example, if you are building an expert system, specify how users will input symptoms and how the system will respond.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Consider performance, usability, and reliability aspects of your application.
- **Technical Requirements:** Identify the technologies and tools you will use, such as programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.

### 3. Design the Application

Create a design for your application that includes:

- **Architecture:** Outline the overall architecture of your application, including components and their interactions.
- **Data Structures:** Define the data structures you will use to represent knowledge, rules, and user inputs.
- **Algorithms:** Describe the algorithms you will implement to perform reasoning, verification, or decision-making.

### 4. Implementation

Begin implementing your application based on the design. Follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Development Environment:** Prepare your programming environment with the necessary tools and libraries.
2. **Code Development:** Implement the application incrementally, focusing on one feature at a time. Use version control to track changes and collaborate with peers.
3. **Testing and Verification:** Test your application thoroughly to ensure it meets the specified requirements. Use formal methods where applicable to verify correctness.

### 5. Documentation

Document your project thoroughly, including:

- **Project Overview:** A brief description of the project, its purpose, and its intended audience.
- **Installation Instructions:** Step-by-step instructions for setting up and running your application.
- **User Guide:** Instructions for users on how to interact with the application and utilize its features.
- **Technical Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the code structure, algorithms, and data models used in the application.

### 6. Prepare for Presentation

Prepare to present your capstone project to the class. Your presentation should include:

- **Project Overview:** Introduce your project, its objectives, and its significance.
- **Demonstration:** Live demonstration of the application, showcasing its features and functionality.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** Discuss any challenges you faced during development and how you addressed them.
- **Lessons Learned:** Reflect on what you learned throughout the project and how it has enhanced your understanding of logical programming and formal methods.

## Presentation of the Capstone Project

### Presentation Format

- **Duration:** Each presentation should be approximately 10-15 minutes long, followed by a Q&A session.
- **Visual Aids:** Use slides or other visual aids to enhance your presentation and engage your audience.
- **Interactive Demonstration:** If possible, provide a live demonstration of your application to showcase its functionality.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your capstone project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Integration of Concepts:** How well you applied the concepts learned throughout the course.
2. **Functionality:** The functionality and usability of the application.
3. **Technical Implementation:** The quality of the code, including organization, documentation, and adherence to best practices.
4. **Presentation Skills:** Clarity, engagement, and effectiveness of the presentation.
